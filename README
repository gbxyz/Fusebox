Fusebox is a highly experimental, pre-pre-alpha attempt to provide 
end-to-end security for Dropbox.

Some users of the Dropbox.com service are worried that the operators of 
that service are able to view their files. To alleviate these fears, 
Fusebox works as a proxy for the Dropbox service: it presents itself as 
a separate filesystem on your computer. When a file is created on this 
filesystem, the file's name and contents are encrypted using symmetric 
AES encryption, and placed in your normal Dropbox folder. The Dropbox 
system itself is then responsible for syncing the files to the Dropbox 
server, and the other devices you have connected to your account.

Fusebox is a Perl script that uses the Fuse module to implement a 
userspace filesystem, and the Crypt::CBC and Crypt::OpenSSL::AES modules 
to do the encryption.

To use it, you will need a .fuseboxrc file that looks like this:

mountpoint=/media/fusebox
dropbox=/your/home/directory/Dropbox
passphrase=[nice strong passphrase]

when Fusebox first runs, it will edit this file to include a random 
"initialisation vector". This has to be stored with the passphrase so 
that encrypted filenames don't change.

If you (securely) copy this file to another machine that's linked to 
your Dropbox account, it will also be able to read the encrypted files.
